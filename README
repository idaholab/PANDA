The quantitative analysis of dislocation-type defects in irradiated materials is critical to materials characterization in the nuclear
energy industry. The conventional approach of an instrument scientist manually identifying any dislocation defects is both
time-consuming and subjective thereby potentially introducing inconsistencies in the quantification. This work approaches
dislocation-type defect identification and segmentation using a standard open source computer vision model, YOLOv8, that
leverages transfer learning to create a highly effective dislocation defect quantification tool while using only a minimal number of
annotated micrographs for training. This model demonstrates the ability to segment both dislocation lines and loops concurrently
in micrographs with high pixel noise levels and on an alloy not represented in the training set. Inference of dislocation defects
using transmission electron microscopy on three different irradiated alloys relevant to the nuclear energy industry are examined
in this work with widely varying pixel noise levels and with completely unrelated composition and dislocation formations for
practical post irradiation examination analysis.
